# Simple Traffic Light

A traffic system that works as a counter using Arduino that counts down from 30 to 0 displayed on 7-segments once the push button is pressed 
then displays MV (as a short for “move”) and remains displayed on the 7 segments until the push button is pressed again. 
When the push button is pressed again after the first 30 seconds, 
a new countdown that counts from 30 starts, at the end of these 30 seconds, it displays “St” (as a short for “stop”) and remains on the 7 segments until the push button is pressed again, 
and so forth.
